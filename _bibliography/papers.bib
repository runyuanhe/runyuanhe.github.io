  title={Automated Discovery of Test Oracles for Database Management Systems Using LLMs},
  author={Mang, Qiuyang and He*, Runyuan and Zhong, Suyang and Liu, Xiaoxuan and Zhang, Huanchen and Cheung, Alvin},

  abstract={This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate the discovery and instantiation of test oracles, addressing a long-standing bottleneck towards fully automated DBMS testing. We introduce Argus, a novel framework built upon the core concept of the Constrained Abstract Query. Argus uses LLMs to generate pairs of SQL skeletons that are asserted to be semantically equivalent, then formally proven using a SQL equivalence solver to ensure soundness.},

@article{li2025continuum,
  abbr={arXiv},
  title={Continuum: Efficient and Robust Multi-Turn LLM Agent Scheduling with KV Cache Time-to-Live},
  author={Li, Hanchen and Mang, Qiuyang and He*, Runyuan and Zhang, Qizheng and Mao, Huanzhi and Chen, Xiaokun and Zhou, Hangrui and Cheung, Alvin and Gonzalez, Joseph and Stoica, Ion},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2511.02230},
  year={2025},
  selected={true},
  bibtex_show={true},
  abstract={We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for multi-turn agent workloads by introducing time-to-live mechanism for KV cache retaining. For LLM request that generates a tool call, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a time-to-live value determined by considering both the reload cost and ordering preserve benefit of retaining KV cache.},
